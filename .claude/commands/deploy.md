Stage all modified HTML files in this project, create a git commit with a clear descriptive message summarizing what changed (following the existing commit style in this repo: short imperative subject line + bullet details), then push to origin main.

Rules:
- Only stage .html files that were intentionally modified (never stage node_modules, temporary screenshots, troubleshoot-ss, website design reference, or any untracked asset folders)
- Write the commit message in the same style as recent commits (look at `git log --oneline -5` first)
- After pushing, confirm the push succeeded and show the commit hash
- Never use --no-verify or --force
